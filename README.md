# MR-DrumKit

MR DrumKit is a first in a series of simple straight forward coe samples for Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers. The demo app focuses on just tracking the motion controller status and position in space in order to overlay a drum stick in place of the controller. For added fun colliders have been added to the drums and sounds are included.
